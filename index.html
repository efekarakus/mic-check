          <h2>Communication</h2>
          <p>
            One of the intricacies of multiplayer esports such as League of Legends (LoL) is that the
            players need to communicate efficiently while playing the game in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this interactive, we explore what communication in a 
            <a href="http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1986803606?tab=overview" target="_blank">game</a> of LoL looks like.
            We recorded the voices of 3 of our players, with each bar representing a second of the game.

          <h2>Distribution</h2>
          <p>
            The players talked on average 5:17 minutes. Which means that they talked ~14.2% of the game time.
            Surprisingly, we can observe that all the players seemed to talk roughly the same amount.

          <p>
            Fiora, is the shot caller of the team, therefore it does make sense that he had the most amount of
            input. However, the difference is not considerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps, in a team like <a href="http://cloud9.gg/" target="_blank">Cloud9</a> where the team 
            captain seems to have a significant impact this distribution would be highly skewed for

          <h2>Food For Thought</h2>
          <p>
            There is so much to explore about how communication affects your in game performance!
            Maybe the volume of the players make a difference? Is there an optimal time to start discussing
            when to take Baron or Dragon?
