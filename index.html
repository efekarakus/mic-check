          <h2>Communication</h2>
          <p>
            In League of Legends, players need to 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ-jzlkQVhs&feature=youtu.be&t=24s" target="_blank">share information</a> with each other in order to kill opponents, or take objectives. 
            Effective communication leads to players knowing which steps to take next, and thus win.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recorded the voices of 3 of our players in a 
            <a href="http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1986803606?tab=overview" target="_blank">game</a> of LoL, 
            where each bar represents a second of the game. Our goal is to explore different aspects of interactions and show the potential of speech analysis
            in competitive video games.
          </p>
          
          <div class="btn" action="play">

        </section>
        <section id="distribution-section" class="step">
          <h2>Distribution</h2>
          <p>
            The players talked on average for 5:17 minutes with the distribution being almost uniform.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the <a href="#communication-section">previous</a> section, we can observe the infamous top lane island as Fiora has
            the lowest amount of contribution during the laning phase. The player becomes more involved as the team starts grouping up and
            take down objectives.

        <section id="objectivecontrol-section" class="step">
          <h2>Objective Control</h2>
          <p>
            While taking objectives, players should be coordinating the action. Furthermore, 
            teammates should not <span class="pink bold">interrupt</span> each other to enable
            a fluid sequence of events.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, we focus on events between 29:00 and 32:00. For example, 
            Fiora kills Yasuo at 30:00 with the help of Hecarim. Although the two players
            were talking during the event, they also interrupted each other.

        <section id="interruptions-section" class="step">
          <h2>Interruptions</h2>
          <p>
            We have highlighted all the interruptions between at least two players during the match.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fiora was interrupted for 98 seconds out of 344 seconds, therefore <span class="pink bold">28.5%</span> of the time another
            player was talking concurrently. Hecarim was interrupted for <span class="pink bold">39.6%</span>, and Zilean for
            <span class="pink bold">35.6%</span> of the time!

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            There is so much to explore about how communication affects your in game performance!
            Maybe the volume of the players make a difference? Is there an optimal time to start discussing
            when to take Baron or Dragon?
          </p>

            Also thanks to my friends Nathan and Chris for recording their voices!
